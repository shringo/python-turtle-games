# Python Turtle Games
i got bored during coding classes so i made these games using only python's turtle library which I found easier than pygame. I don't think I referred or copied any online sources, so these should be original.

## Games
- Seizures or colored static generator - not really a game, more of a test on what turtle can do.
- Tic Tac Toe - requires 2 players.
- Connect 4/Emotional 3 - Anywhere from 2 to 10 players, allows boards anywhere from 7x6 (default) to 21x18, and random turns.
- Minesweeper - Singleplayer, literally minesweeper. This was my AP CSP project. The file itself will contain detailed comments for the Collegeboard graders, or anyone interested.
- Off brand Osu! (Click on the turtle that changes size and moves to random places onscreen)

## How to run
Tested against Python 3.12.5 on pyenv, built with tcl-tk for tkinter support, which turtle requires.
